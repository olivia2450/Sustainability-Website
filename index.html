                    <p>
                        Sustainability is an environmental and social goal made for the good of people inhabitting the Earth in the future.
                        Sustainable development supports this long-term goal with the implementation of systems, frameworks, and support from global, national, and local entities.
                        Sustainable development can be defined as an approach to the economic & environmental development of a nation without compromising with the quality of the environment for future generations.
                        Examples of Sustainable Development includes: safeguarding water, saving energy, reducing waste, using recyclable packaging, limiting the use of plastics, using sustainable transport, reusing paper and protecting flora and fauna, etc.

                    How important is Sustainability and Sustainable Development?

                <p>
                    Maintaining sustainability will mean that we prevent environmental crisis.
                    This refers to the situation when an environment fails to perform its vital function of life sustenance
                    environmental crisis can further destruct community's life and give a negative long term effect to our earth. This can further leads to global warming, destruction of the ozone shield, acidification of land and water, desertification and soil loss, deforestation and forest decline, diminishing productivity of land and waters, and extinction of species and populations, demonstrate that human demand is exceeding environmental support capacities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustainable development itself is important to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and sustainable, 
                    social well-being is improved, and environmental quality is maintained. This borderline acts as a reminder for everyone that as we work towards achieving something, we also need to take into consideration of other species too. Hence, sustainable developments are important
                    as we work towards creating a safer and better environment for humans to live in while preserving other species too, on earth.

                            Charity movements are evoked globally, to promote a sustainable form of living in which we can all help support others to obtain the same environmental-friendly life. Environmental Charities New Zealand, for instance, is a foundation which opens lots of donation boards so that it allows everyone to have the opportunity to help others in the community.

                            Efforts including : sourcing renewable materials in manufacturing products, powering operations with low-carbon or carbon-free energy, and creating products with a lower carbon footprint, as well as other company policies that help preserve the long-term viability of our planet's resources, have been done by several companies to help obtain sustainability.
                            Companies like Google and Apple have already cut their energy use by 40%. Microsoft plans on becoming carbon-negative by 2030. Environmental innovation efforts will save green companies money, and it's vital for the fight against climate change too.
